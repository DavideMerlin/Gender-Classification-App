# Gender-Classification-App
This gender classifier uses [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) ML library to train a Decision Tree on a dataset of body measures (height, width, and shoe size) based on sex (labeled male or female). Consequentially, we can predict someone's gender by setting specific body metrics as input.
